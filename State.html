  <h1>State change & stability</h1>
</div>


<p>My main interest, generally stated, is in the μορφή in geomorphology, the emergence and detection of patterns, shapes, and order in landscapes, and the how this order interacts with human systems, primarily via construction of mathematical models and comparison with remotely sensed landscapes and measurable biogeophysical processes. Thus I’m also interested in statistical methods that test what’s typically taken for granted (e.g. the presence of and quantification of power laws in landscapes), robust tests of spatial similarity, and application of network and systems analysis to geomorphic systems.</p>

<p>These interests have led me to sandy places like atoll islands or desert margins. For one thing, landforms there exhibit both varying shapes depending on the local fluid dynamics (there’s some commonality in the shaping dunes by wind and atoll islands by currents and waves), with sudden changes regulated by a combination of climatic, biological, and now human influences.</p>
